# tv-shows-api-capstone

A responsive website that pulls data from the open API TvMaze.
Users type in a TV show in the input and submit. The site returns the show entered with a summary of the show and user ratings if available.

## User Cases
1. Someone who is looking to find out more information about a show that they are interested in such as it's popularity and general information.

## Working Prototype
https://garrettmcgowan.github.io/tv-shows-api-capstone/

## Functionality
The app's functionality includes:
* The ability to find shows submitted in the input
* The ability to show specific information on the shows submitted.

## Technology
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery

* The app uses AJAX JSON calls to the <a href="https://www.tvmaze.com/api">TvMaze</a>Open Platform API to return Tv show information such as general show information and show ratings.

## Responsive
App is built to be responsive across mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop screen resolutions.

## Development Roadmap
* In the future, I would like to implement the Tastedive API for tv show suggestions.
